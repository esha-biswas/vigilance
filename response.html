            <p> Remember u said on that day...perhaps we r not batman we r normal human...if we think batman is also a
                simple human with advanced armour. when we say we r batman, we dont have to match the lifestyle, we see
                how silently we serve justice to our own emotion alone in the dark... not just batman, we relate
                ourselves with many character if u think so....with the character of a poetry... with a silent suffered
                unseen victim of a movie...we just relate, not become...its just batman gives us a sense of power
                *wink*.
            </p>
            <p>This depression thing... i onced faced it , a major one... n a lot now n then..small ones...it
                was the worst n darkest phase ... completely lost in life, couldn't find steps to take ahead in life ...stagnent
                trapped in that darkness... suffocating... no social touch no light nothing used to excite me...i was
                too young i believe to deal with depression n actually that phase tought me a lot...i deal with these
                phases by taking a shelter in silent open corner n talking to myself...coz noone knows or understand
                myself better than me .. its strange i actually have all the answers...i talk with myself like two person
                talk...whether its about life career relationship love friendship whatever...i comeup with solution how
                to deal with a certain situation or how to tackle or face a person etc etc... but most of the pain are
                concluded with acceptance...accepting what happened or happening... </p>
            <p>im sorry what u r going through for one year...idk but for others dealing with depression varies...but i
                wish u get a way out as soon as possible...u have a very flourishing future...seriously dont remain
                stuck in it...try to recover such that even if u remember u wont be affected by it...i mean since the
                day i have accepted my past i dont even remember or even if i remember it doesnt affect... i have wasted
                my 8 percious years in life...n stay alive *hahaha*, i want u to see doing okay when i will come in
                nov... i have tried to commit suicide in 2020... dont try that stunt...*haha*</p>
            <p>believe in urself...u have lot of potential...get inspired from ur own deed...uk u r exactly where u
                should be... yes im not saying u have to settle down there... but u r in right place...sooner or later u will realise that...u will be able to connect dots...dont compare
                urself with anyone...compare urself with u...everyones stituation n conditions r different... n they r subjected to that...then
                u should also compare to those who never got the oppurtunity to study where u r studying...thats not how
                it works...if u want to get something from someone...take their target, not journey..that wont be
                same...have that target n work hard in ur own way in ur own style under the constraints u r in...trust the
                process trust the journeyy n most importantly time...u will get the exact thing u r supposed to get n u
                will get that u deserve off course...so we work harder n harder to deserve better something. all the best..</p>
            <p>uk i feel broken people have a void inside them..to me its in a jar ...sometimes echos a lot
                loudly...this inside of jar has so much pressure that it already got cracks on its wall...i fear someday
                this jar might not explode... thenn everything will be void ...</p>
            <p>maybe u were meant to meet me in the end, to end well... i let 7 8 people to touch me (like just touch
                not beyond ) in these 2 yrs on my consent... but i felt ur touch n everything most respecting caring
                comfortable n loving... not saying to impress u...genuinely thank you ... we met at a very strange time...
            </p>
            <p>i am sorry that sometimes i behave n talk so immaturely with u...i feel thankfull whatever the time we
                got together... im sorry but its funny i actually had a small plan for our last meet if u dont mind me
                to say...i felt like u enjoy normal plain food so i thought of cooking for us some simple daal bhaat n
                few more bengali dishes... thought of having one last bed wreaking sex . ..of u wildly dominating me...
                thought of showing my new onion color bikini pantie that coindentaly matches with my bra color *haha*...
                ignore this.. i am really grateful what we had...
                when i said u were looking the most handsome man on farewell night, i meant it *wink*. maybe most
                handsome person in dept...idk i find so n i fancy it ... beauty lies in the eye of beholder... i am glad
                that i have seen ur utterly most striking handsomeness when u used to come out of  shower 
                with wet hair n just in towel n bare body... ohh bodyy...smoking hot *eye roll*. one of the sexiest
                moment i had with u is once during sex, u were moaning while we were kissing...most iconic moment in my life to be honest *haha*...u r a very special lean thin
                guy...best sex i had is only with u...i fantasize u in one thing n that is u riding bike wearing ur
                black shirt .... *haha* u must be thinking how stupid i am...i am actually...damaged delusional
                deranged...</p>

            <p>okayy...done here...takee care... have proper sleep n food...focus on ur work...if u get stuck to get
                solution, try to teach it to someone...see ya...bye
            </p>
